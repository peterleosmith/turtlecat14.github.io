# Peter L. Smith

Although I have a civil engineering degree from the University of Pittsburgh,
I have worked on **mechanical, electrical, networking, cybersecurity, reliability, systems, and software engineering** projects. 

Most of my experience has been in the nuclear industry, but I recently began working as a verification & validation engineer on embedded software for medical devices. 

I joined Upstream to learn a new skill to potentially open doors in the future and to help with some current side projects. :turtle::cat:
